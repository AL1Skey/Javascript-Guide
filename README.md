# Javascript-Guide
The simplify notes about how javascript entirely different from python or any "not-so" scripting language

# How to understand javascript
This will contain my hypotesis after many exposure of javascript shenanigan

1. Think javascript not as "step-by-step" executed function, but rather as "your entire code inside your js file are being executed successfully whether you like it or not".

Javascript **WILL** finish it's jobs before the Interface(UI/UX) being showed on your website no matter how non-sensical your code are.

2. Only put one purpose on one Javascript file

Means you need to restrain yourself from put everything inside your file (like putting list of function that you'll never call)

3. Use OOP instead Functional Programming

Because in javascript, Class behave like soldier waiting their order and functional programming behave like Someone who're soo fixated on to-do list that they indirectly became the reason why Franz Ferdinand dies (He dies on traffic accident).
